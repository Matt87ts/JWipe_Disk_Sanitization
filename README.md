# JWipe - Disk Sanitization

<h2>Description</h2>
This Prohect consists of a simple Powershell script that walks user through zeroing out/wiping any drive that is connected to the system. The utility allows you to select the target disk and choose the number of passes that are performed. The Powershell script will configure a disk partition script file based on the user's selection and then launch Diskpart to perform the sanitization.
